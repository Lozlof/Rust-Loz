// Rust doesn’t yet include random number functionality in its standard library. However, the Rust team does provide a rand crate with said functionality.
/* Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. 
   The project we’ve been building is a binary crate, which is an executable. 
   The rand crate is a library crate, which contains code that is intended to be used in other programs and can’t be executed on its own. */
// Before we can write code that uses rand, we need to modify the Cargo.toml file to include the rand crate as a dependency.
/* [package]
   name = "guessing_game"
   version = "0.1.0"
   edition = "2021"

   [dependencies]
   rand = "0.8.5" */
/* When you do want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command update, which will ignore the Cargo.lock file and figure out all the latest versions that fit your specifications in Cargo.toml. 
   Cargo will then write those versions to the Cargo.lock file. */
