# Scalar Types        
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recognize these from other programming languages. Let‚Äôs jump into how they work in Rust.                    
## Integer        
An integer is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer type in Chapter 2, the u32 type. This type declaration indicates that the value it‚Äôs associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start with i instead of u) that takes up 32 bits of space.     
**Integer Table**    
```                                         
Length	Signed	Unsigned         
8-bit	i8	        u8          
16-bit	i16	        u16         
32-bit	i32	        u32           
64-bit	i64	        64                 
128-bit	i128	    u128       
arch	isize	    usize       
```                   
**Signed -** Means it can be negative, hence the sign "-32".                  
**Unsigned -** Means it will always be posative.            
Signed numbers are stored using two‚Äôs complement representation.       
Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.             
Additionally, the isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as ‚Äúarch‚Äù: 64 bits if you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you‚Äôre on a 32-bit architecture.             
**Integer Literals**              
```                                           
Number literals	Example               
Decimal	        98_222          
Hex	            0xff          
Octal	        0o77             
Binary	        0b1111_0000            
Byte (u8 only)	b'A'      
```                                        
**So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you‚Äôre unsure, Rust‚Äôs defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to i32. The primary situation in which you‚Äôd use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.**              
**Integer Overflow**
```                                     
Let‚Äôs say you have a variable of type u8 that can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, such as 256, integer overflow will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors. When you‚Äôre compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your program to panic at runtime if this behavior occurs. Rust uses the term panicking when a program exits with an error; we‚Äôll discuss panics in more depth in the ‚ÄúUnrecoverable Errors with panic!‚Äù section in Chapter 9.

When you‚Äôre compiling in release mode with the --release flag, Rust does not include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs two‚Äôs complement wrapping. In short, values greater than the maximum value the type can hold ‚Äúwrap around‚Äù to the minimum of the values the type can hold. In the case of a u8, the value 256 becomes 0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won‚Äôt panic, but the variable will have a value that probably isn‚Äôt what you were expecting it to have. Relying on integer overflow‚Äôs wrapping behavior is considered an error.

To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:

    Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add.
    Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods.
    Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods.
    Saturate at the value‚Äôs minimum or maximum values with the saturating_* methods.
```                                
## Floating-Point Types                      
Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust‚Äôs floating-point types are f32 and f64, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs, it‚Äôs roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types are signed.                   
## Numeric Operations           
Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you‚Äôd expect for all the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer.       
```                                       
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}                       
```                               
## Boolean                        
As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: true and false. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using bool.         
```
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```                              
## Character             
Rust‚Äôs char type is the language‚Äôs most primitive alphabetic type.           
```          
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = '‚Ñ§'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'üòª';
}
```            
Note that we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. Rust‚Äôs char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. However, a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù is may not match up with what a char is in Rust.                              
# Compound Types                
Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.          
## Tuple      
A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.       
We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses.       
```    
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```           
The variable tup binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:      
```     
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```        
This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable tup. It then uses a pattern with let to take tup and turn it into three separate variables, x, y, and z. This is called destructuring because it breaks the single tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of y, which is 6.4.         
We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access. For example:                    
```            
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```        
This program creates the tuple x and then accesses each element of the tuple using their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first index in a tuple is 0.                 
The tuple without any values has a special name, unit. This value and its corresponding type are both written () and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don‚Äôt return any other value.                 
## Array      
Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.      
```         
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```      
Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap.     
An array isn‚Äôt as flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you‚Äôre unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector.               
However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change. For example, if you were using the names of the month in a program, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know it will always contain 12 elements.     
Here, i32 is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number 5 indicates the array contains five elements.       
```    
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```        
You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:          
```         
let a = [3; 5];
```         
An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing, like this:         
```       
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```
